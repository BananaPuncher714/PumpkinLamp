# Pumpkin Lamp
Adds custom jack o'lanterns that turn off when a redstone signal is applied to them. This plugin was created as a demonstration on how to use the [Dimensional Block Library](https://github.com/BananaPuncher714/DimensionalBlocks) and what it can be used to achieve. The pumpkins themselves are a custom block with the id minecraft:pumpkin_lamp and can be set using the /setblock command. It contains 2 blockstates, lit(true, false) and facing(north, east, south, west).
